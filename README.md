# FlamApp AI – Research & Development Assignment

## Overview

This project estimates the unknown parameters **θ (Theta), M, and X** of the given parametric curve using the provided dataset (`xy_data.csv`).

The solution uses numerical optimization and nearest-neighbor matching to fit the generated curve to the given point cloud.

---

# Problem Statement

Estimate the unknown parameters of the following parametric equations:

\[
x=t\cos(\theta)-e^{M|t|}\sin(0.3t)\sin(\theta)+X
\]

\[
y=42+t\sin(\theta)+e^{M|t|}\sin(0.3t)\cos(\theta)
\]

Subject to:

- **0° < θ < 50°**
- **-0.05 < M < 0.05**
- **0 < X < 100**
- **6 < t < 60**

# Methodology

## 1. Data Exploration

- Loaded the provided dataset.
- Verified dataset dimensions.
- Checked for missing values.
- Visualized the input curve.

## 2. Dataset Analysis

The dataset was inspected by plotting consecutive points.

The visualization showed that the CSV points are **unordered**, making direct row-by-row comparison unsuitable.

## 3. Mathematical Model

The given parametric equations were implemented exactly as provided.

The parameter **t** was uniformly sampled between **6 and 60**.

## 4. Optimization

The unknown parameters were estimated using:

- Differential Evolution (SciPy)
- KDTree-based nearest-neighbor matching
- Bounded optimization according to assignment constraints

The objective function minimizes the total nearest-neighbor distance between the generated curve and the observed dataset.

## 5. Visualization

The optimized curve was plotted together with the original dataset to visually validate the fitting.

# How to Run

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run optimization

```bash
cd src
python optimize.py
```

Generate visualization

```bash
python visualize.py
```

# Assumptions

- Parameter **t** is uniformly sampled in the interval **[6, 60]**.
- Since the dataset points are unordered, nearest-neighbor matching was used instead of row-wise comparison.
- Differential Evolution was selected because it performs well for nonlinear optimization problems.

---

# Future Improvements

- One-to-one point matching using the Hungarian Algorithm.
- Local optimization refinement after global optimization.
- Faster convergence using hybrid optimization techniques.
- Automatic uncertainty estimation of parameters.
